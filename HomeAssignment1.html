            Dragon fruit, as the name suggests, resembles a dragon. It grows on
            climbing cactus , which can be found in tropical regions. Pitaya is
            a vine-like crawling cactus with aerial roots. It has fleshy
            succulent stems. The flowers are large and perfumed. They are white
            with yellow centres. Flowers open in the evening and finish in the
            early morning, lasting just one night. Pitaya skin is bright pink,
            crimson or red with fleshy green scales. The flesh is white or red
            with many small black seeds. Dragon fruit is juicy with a slightly
            sweet taste that some describe as a cross between a kiwi, a pear,
            and a watermelon. The seeds have a nutty flavor.

          <h2>How to grow your own Pitaya ?</h2>
          <p>
            All over the country, except for areas with extreme temperatures,
            hot or cold. The cactus should be placed in a semi-shady area or in
            the northern part of the garden.
            <br />
            Recommended planting season: All year round.
            <br />
            Special care: In order to produce fruit you must plant two types of
            pitaya (both of which can be purchased at the nursery), to promote
            pollination. it very recommended performing manual pollination .
            <br />
            Growing pitayas requires not just providing plants with the right
            amount of light and water, but also entails offering support, and
            most often, a raised bed or container of some sort to ensure
            adequate drainage.
            <br />
            Pitaya prefers a dry, tropical climate with average temperatures
            between 21 to 29 degrees Celsius. It can put up with temperatures up
            to 40 Celsius and as low as 0 Celsius for short periods. It needs
            600mm to 1,300mm of rain annually and needs Wet and Dry seasons.
            Pitaya needs some shade as it can be damaged by a lot of light. It
            thrives in sandy soil with lots of organic matter.

          <h2>Good To Know</h2>
          <p>
            be aware of the side effects of the dragon fruit .
            <br />
            Consuming too much dietary fiber can lead to several stomach
            problems, such as bloating, gas, diarrhea, and constipation. This is
            because dietary fiber absorbs water and swells in the stomach,
            making you feel full and reducing hunger.
            <br />
            While this can be beneficial for weight loss, consuming too much
            fiber can cause discomfort and digestive problems. While
            antioxidants are important for our health, it is also important to
            remember that too much of a good thing can be harmful. In fact,
            research suggests that excessive consumption of antioxidants can
            have negative effects on the body.
            <br />
            <b>Too Many Is Too Bad!</b>
            <br />
            Dragon fruit contains several proteins which may trigger an allergic
            reaction in some individuals. Allergic reactions are relatively
            rare, but they have been reported in some cases. If you have a known
            allergy to other fruits, such as kiwi or pineapple, you may be at a
            higher risk of developing an allergy to dragon fruit.
